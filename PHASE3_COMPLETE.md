## 💡 KEY INNOVATIONS

### **1. Dynamic Pet Bonuses**
Bonuses scale with **both** level AND happiness:
```typescript
bonus = baseBonus × (1 + level × 0.05) × (happiness / 100)
```
A level 10 pet at 100% happiness gives **1.5x** the bonus of level 1 at 50% happiness!

### **2. Exponential Combo Rewards**
```
1-2 correct:  1.0x multiplier
3-4 correct:  1.25x multiplier
5-9 correct:  1.5x multiplier
10-19 correct: 2.0x multiplier
20-49 correct: 2.5x multiplier
50+ correct:   3.0x multiplier (MAX!)
```
Plus milestone bonuses every 5 combo!

### **3. Rarity-Based Treasure Scaling**
```
COMMON:    1.0x rewards
UNCOMMON:  1.5x rewards
RARE:      2.0x rewards
EPIC:      3.0x rewards
LEGENDARY: 5.0x rewards
MYTHIC:    10.0x rewards
```
A Mythic chest gives **10 times** the rewards of a Common chest!

### **4. Interconnected Systems**
Every action has cascading effects:
- Solve problem → Update 3 quest types → Level up pet → Contribute to guild → Award battle pass XP → Maybe drop chest → Update combo → Track analytics

This creates the **"one more problem"** psychology that makes games addictive!
