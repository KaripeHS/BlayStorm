## 📝 Technical Notes

### API Endpoints in Use
- 30+ engagement endpoints
- All CRUD operations
- Proper authentication
- Error responses
- Type-safe responses

### Hook Pattern
Every feature follows this pattern:
```typescript
export function useFeature() {
  const [data, setData] = useState<Type[]>([]);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  const [error, setError] = useState<Error | null>(null);

  const fetchData = useCallback(async () => {
    // Fetch logic
  }, []);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchData();
  }, [fetchData]);

  const action = useCallback(async (params) => {
    await api.action(params);
    await fetchData(); // Auto-refresh
  }, [fetchData]);

  return { data, loading, error, action, refresh: fetchData };
}
```

### Page Wrapper Pattern
Every page follows this pattern:
```typescript
const FeaturePage = () => {
  const { data, loading, actions } = useFeature();
  const [studentData, setStudentData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Fetch student stats
  }, []);

  if (loading || !studentData) {
    return <LoadingScreen />;
  }

  return (
    <FeatureComponent
      data={data}
      studentData={studentData}
      onAction={actions.action}
    />
  );
};
```
